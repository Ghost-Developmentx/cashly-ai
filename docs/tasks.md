# Cashly-AI Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks for the Cashly-AI codebase. Each task is
logically ordered and covers both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Implement a proper layered architecture
    - [ ] Separate business logic from API endpoints in app.py
    - [ ] Create a clear separation between controllers, services, and data access layers
    - [ ] Move Flask route handlers to a dedicated controllers directory

2. [ ] Refactor large service classes into smaller, focused components
    - [ ] Split FinLearningService into separate NLP, intent classification, and learning components
    - [ ] Split AssistantFactory into separate classes for each assistant type
    - [ ] Create a common base class for all assistant configurations

3. [ ] Implement dependency injection
    - [ ] Create a dependency injection container
    - [ ] Configure services with their dependencies
    - [ ] Remove direct instantiation of dependencies in service constructors

4. [ ] Improve error handling architecture
    - [ ] Create a centralized error handling mechanism
    - [ ] Implement custom exception classes for different error types
    - [ ] Add proper error logging and reporting

5. [ ] Enhance configuration management
    - [ ] Move all configuration to a centralized location
    - [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration
    - [ ] Use a configuration management library

## Code Quality Improvements

6. [ ] Refactor large methods
    - [ ] Break down methods longer than 50 lines
    - [ ] Extract helper methods for complex logic
    - [ ] Ensure each method has a single responsibility


7. [ ] Enhance type annotations
    - [ ] Add comprehensive type hints to all functions
    - [ ] Create custom type definitions for complex data structures
    - [ ] Use generic types where appropriate

8. [ ] Implement proper logging
    - [ ] Add structured logging throughout the application
    - [ ] Configure different log levels for development and production
    - [ ] Add request ID to all logs for traceability

## Performance Improvements

    - [ ] Implement batch processing for NLP operations
    - [ ] Consider using more efficient models for simple tasks

14. [ ] Improve API performance
