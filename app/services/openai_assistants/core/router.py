    AssistantRouter is responsible for managing routing logic between
    different assistants based on predefined patterns, triggers, and other
    criteria.

    This class provides methods for determining if re-routing should occur,
    identifying the correct target assistant for handling a user query,
    and validating routing paths between assistants. Its purpose is to
    facilitate seamless collaboration between different assistants and
    efficiently manage query redirection when needed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    routing_patterns : Optional[Dict]
        A dictionary defining routing patterns between assistants. Patterns
        specify source assistants, target assistants, and their respective
        triggers for re-routing.
    trigger_phrases : list
        List of phrases or keywords that may trigger re-routing behavior.
    assistant_mentions : Dict[str, AssistantType]
        A mapping of specific assistant mentions to their respective
        AssistantType enums. Used to determine the referenced assistant
        within a query or response.
